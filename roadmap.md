# Better DeepWiki Roadmap (Rust)

> **Philosophy:** opinionated simplicity, robustness, and performance; every milestone must deliver direct value without adding unnecessary complexity.

---

## 0Ô∏è‚É£ Completed ‚Äì v0.1 ‚úÖ

- **CLI application:** minimal RAG (repository traversal, embeddings, question/answer)

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ v0.3 ‚Äì Graphical Interface

- HTTP API served by **axum**
- Minimal **React** UI written in **TypeScript**: query field, answer display, highlighted context

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ v0.2 ‚Äì Dockerization

- Official lightweight container bundling the Rust binary **and an embedded Qdrant instance** for vector storage
- One‚Äëcommand deployment with `docker compose`

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ v0.4 ‚Äì RAG Optimisation & OpenAI Support

- Option to use OpenAI embeddings and completions
- Improved ranking with tunable parameters
- **Explanatory schema generation at embedding time** to visualise key codebase features

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ v0.5 ‚Äì Sessions & Context

- Session mechanism enabling **iterative queries**, carrying intermediate answers forward as context
- Configurable TTL and memory budget

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ v0.6 ‚Äì Deep‚ÄëSearching

- Iterative queries ("rounds") to refine answers
- `--depth` parameter to control search depth
- Guardrails to avoid loops and excessive cost

## üåê Cross‚Äëcutting tasks

| Axis | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Security | Dependency audit, secret management |
| DX | Readable logs, actionable errors, examples |
| Documentation | Guides, architecture diagrams, changelog |
